NixOS Pinebook Pro Configuration

README.md is a todo item, just like the rest of this. It will be fleshed out when the configuration is mostly stable. 

I am still working on building out a usable desktop environment (i3wm based). and am trying to ensure all the hardware is working at the same time. This is aalso my first NixOS system, so I am having to learn the language as well. 

This repo also adds a patch to overclock the Pinebook pro, adding steps to go up to 2.2 Ghz on the big cores, 1.7 Ghz on the little cores, and a small overclock to 950Mhz on the GPU.
